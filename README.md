# wmux

[![CI](https://github.com/gisenberg/wmux/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/gisenberg/wmux/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A single-user browser terminal multiplexer for Tailscale and private networks.

wmux provides:

- local, SSH, PowerShell-over-SSH, and experimental Windows-agent terminals,
- durable workspaces, tabs, splits, activity, and direct links,
- `ghostty-web` terminal rendering with desktop and mobile controls,
- browser-aware clipboard, media, notifications, and screen streaming,
- static machine configuration or dynamic host registration.

Terminal settings include a full-screen redraw cap at 15 FPS by default, 30 FPS,
or 60 FPS and scrolling mode: Performance
(batched, default) or Smooth (immediate). Normal shell output remains low-latency;
the redraw cap applies only while an alternate-screen application is active.

> [!CAUTION]
> wmux grants terminal access to its machines. It is designed for one trusted
> user behind loopback, Tailscale, or another private network boundary—not the
> public Internet. Do not expose it through a public bind or unrestricted proxy.

## Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Browser client | Canvas 2D cell-grid chrome with semantic DOM controls where required, `ghostty-web` terminals, mobile controls, media, text/image clipboard handling, and stream views |
| HTTP transport | Declarative route table with stable route ids, exact method/path matching, body limits, authorization policy, request dispatch, static delivery, event publication, and WebSocket upgrades |
| Node.js service | Private-network boundary, bearer authentication, bounded REST uploads, event WebSocket, and canonical workspace state |
| Agent sessions | `AgentSessionService` owns persisted delegation transitions and side effects; the versioned timeline store retains prompts, outcomes, touched files, and archived working-tree snapshots; Codex, Claude, and OpenCode adapters own runtime-specific TUI and optional headless behavior |
| Session manager | One live client per pane, persisted registered-host disposal snapshots, temporary image staging, bounded replay, VT checkpoints, resize ownership, and dispatch through the shared `SessionBackend` contract |
| Machine catalog | Merges static `wmux.config.json` machines with dynamically registered heartbeat hosts |
| Execution backends | Raw PTY, durable `tmux`/`screen`, and native session-agent adapters; POSIX and Windows agents own pane processes, replay, dynamic-registration heartbeat, and view-only capture supervision |
| Shared contracts | TypeScript browser/server protocol plus generated Python delegation and Windows-agent constants checked by `npm run check:contracts` |
| Persistent state | Workspace layout, delegation outcomes, registered-host disposal endpoints, settings, persistent mobile attachments, and metadata under `~/.wmux`; expiring paste-image stages are not workspace state |
| Optional streaming | Native-agent-supervised, lease-driven MediaMTX capture for view-only streams, plus a separate Moonlight/Sunshine gateway for Moonlight-native interaction |

The server owns canonical workspace state and one live session client per
pane. Browsers are attachable views: refreshing or closing a browser does not
kill a pane, while explicitly closing a pane, tab, or workspace does. Execution
and capture remain on the target machine; the viewing browser does not provide
the terminal process or screen pixels.

The event WebSocket sends ordered, revision-numbered domain deltas for ordinary state changes.
Clients fetch a full bootstrap snapshot only for initial load, reconnect recovery, an event revision gap, or a domain that has not been converted to deltas.

## Quick Start

Server requirements: Linux or macOS, Node.js 22+, npm, and `/bin/sh` with a
supported local PTY environment. Windows is supported as a remote
`powershell-ssh` target, but not as the wmux server host. Running the complete
development check (`npm run check`) additionally requires Bash and Python 3;
individual TypeScript and client build commands may work elsewhere, but the
full development workflow is supported on Linux and macOS.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3478
```

For development with Vite HMR:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3478
```

To listen on Tailscale, use the machine's Tailscale IPv4 address:

```bash
npm run start -- --host 100.x.y.z --port 3478
```

wmux refuses wildcard and public bind addresses by default. It accepts
loopback, Tailscale `100.64.0.0/10`, RFC1918, and IPv6 ULA addresses. If an
internal network uses another range, explicitly allow only that exact IP or
CIDR with `WMUX_ALLOWED_BIND_RANGES`:

```bash
WMUX_ALLOWED_BIND_RANGES=198.18.20.0/24 npm run start -- --host 198.18.20.44 --port 3478
```

This variable is a security-boundary override; do not use it to expose wmux on
a public address or with a wildcard CIDR.

For HTTPS, set both certificate paths and the browser-facing URL:

```bash
WMUX_CERT_FILE=~/.wmux/certs/wmux-host.tailnet.ts.net.crt \
WMUX_KEY_FILE=~/.wmux/certs/wmux-host.tailnet.ts.net.key \
WMUX_PUBLIC_URL=https://wmux-host.tailnet.ts.net:3478 \
npm run start -- --host 100.x.y.z --port 3478
```

For a Tailscale MagicDNS host, install the certificate and a daily renewal
timer with:

```bash
sudo tailscale set --operator="$USER"
WMUX_CERT_DOMAIN=wmux-host.tailnet.ts.net \
  scripts/install-tailscale-cert-service.sh
```

The installer writes owner-protected material under `~/.wmux/certs` and
enables `wmux-cert-renew.timer`. The timer renews within 30 days of expiry and
restarts `wmux.service` only after a certificate was replaced. Pass the paths
printed by the installer to `scripts/install-user-service.sh` through
`WMUX_CERT_FILE`, `WMUX_KEY_FILE`, and `WMUX_PUBLIC_URL`.

HTTPS is required for browser secure-context APIs such as Moonlight/WebCodecs.
If managed SSH hosts cannot reach the browser-facing URL, set `WMUX_HELPER_URL`
to their private callback URL. It affects staged helpers and agent callbacks
only; browser links continue to use `WMUX_PUBLIC_URL`.

### User service and containers

Install or refresh the systemd user service with:

```bash
scripts/install-user-service.sh
```

It chooses the first Tailscale IPv4 address when available. Override it with
`WMUX_HOST`, `WMUX_PORT`, `WMUX_CERT_FILE`, `WMUX_KEY_FILE`,
`WMUX_PUBLIC_URL`, and `WMUX_ALLOWED_BIND_RANGES`, and (when helper callbacks
need a different private route) `WMUX_HELPER_URL`.

```bash
systemctl --user status wmux.service
systemctl --user restart wmux.service
journalctl --user -u wmux.service -f
```

For the non-root Compose deployment, see
[deploy/docker/README.md](deploy/docker/README.md).

## Machines

The checkout-local `wmux.config.json` is ignored by Git. Copy the public
template or use `~/.wmux/config.json`:

```bash
cp wmux.config.example.json wmux.config.json
```

```json
{
  "terminalFontFamily": "\"MesloLGM Nerd Font\"",
  "terminalFontSize": 15,
  "shellCommandTracking": false,
  "delegation": {
    "preferHeadless": false,
    "waitTimeoutSeconds": {
      "review": 1800,
      "change": 7200,
      "deploy": 7200
    }
  },
  "machines": [
    {
      "id": "linux-box",
      "name": "Linux Box",
      "kind": "ssh",
      "platform": "linux",
      "host": "linux-box.tailnet-name.ts.net",
      "user": "operator"
    },
    {
      "id": "windows-box",
      "name": "Windows Box",
      "kind": "powershell-ssh",
      "platform": "win",
      "host": "windows-box",
      "user": "operator",
      "loadPowerShellProfile": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- Open **Settings -> Manage machines** or run **Manage machines** from the
  command palette to add, edit, and remove static machines without server shell
  access.
- The editor writes `~/.wmux/config.json` with owner-only permissions and a
  validated rolling backup.
  `WMUX_MANAGED_CONFIG_PATH` overrides that write destination for isolated
  tests.
  After the first editor save, its marked machine catalog overrides only the
  machine list in a checkout-local config; the existing precedence for
  keybindings, terminal defaults, and delegation settings is unchanged.
- Machine IDs are permanent identities after creation.
  Change the machine name when a user-facing label needs to change.
- The same editor can rename, disable, enable, and delete dynamic
  registrations.
  It never creates, accepts, or displays registration, agent, or stream tokens;
  provision those credentials through the documented setup flow.
- `WMUX_CONFIG_PATH` selects one explicit file and disables fallback.
- `terminalFontFamily` accepts a browser CSS font-family stack and `terminalFontSize` accepts an integer from 10 through 24.
  These values are startup-loaded defaults; restart wmux after changing them.
  wmux bundles `"MesloLGM Nerd Font"` (the terminal-safe Mono variant) and Fira Code.
  Other preferred fonts must be installed on each browser device, and wmux appends its bundled Fira Code/monospace fallback stack.
- `terminalFontFamily` is config-only.
  Settings saved in `~/.wmux/settings.json` can override `terminalFontSize`; use **Settings → Reset → Save** to adopt a changed size default.
- `shellCommandTracking` opts wmux-managed interactive bash and zsh sessions into best-effort preexec/precmd reporting through the existing Activity run history.
  It defaults to `false`, does not modify non-wmux-managed or unsupported shells, and takes effect for newly created panes after wmux restarts.
  Command text is persisted in wmux state, so leave this disabled when shell commands may contain secrets.
  Existing shell traps and unusual prompt frameworks can prevent detection; use `wmux-run` when exact tracking is required.
- `delegation.waitTimeoutSeconds` configures how long synchronous delegation controllers watch before detaching.
  Review mode defaults to 1,800 seconds, while change and deploy modes default to 7,200 seconds.
  Values must be from 0.1 through 14,400 seconds.
  Existing configs that omit this object receive the mode defaults.
  Restart wmux after changing these startup-loaded values so `/api/bootstrap` publishes them to the CLI and generated plugin.
- `delegation.preferHeadless` opts non-interactive delegation into runtime-specific structured/headless adapters when one is available.
  It defaults to `false`, and interactive TUI work always remains terminal-attached.
- `delegation.notificationBudgetSeconds` sets running and waiting state-age budgets.
  Defaults are 7,200 seconds for running and 300 seconds for waiting, with accepted values from 1 second through 7 days.
  wmux checks these budgets every 15 seconds and emits one durable browser notification per exceeded state interval.
  A later state transition starts a fresh interval.
- wmux adds the local machine unless `"localMachine": false` is set.
- `kind: "local"` always executes on the current wmux server. Its display
  name does not make it a remote target, and its `cwd` must exist on that
  server.

- Local and POSIX SSH machines default to `sessionBackend: "auto"`, preferring
  `tmux`, then `screen`; use `"pty"` to force a raw session.
- Linux and macOS machines can use `sessionBackend: "agent"` for a native,
  supervised PTY owner that survives a wmux service restart without requiring
  `tmux` or `screen`.
- Use `kind: "powershell-ssh"` for Windows hosts reached from Linux or macOS.
  It requires OpenSSH Server and PowerShell 7 on Windows.
- Static `powershell-ssh` machines may set `"loadPowerShellProfile": true` to
  load PowerShell's standard profile chain in new direct and agent-backed
  panes. It defaults to disabled. wmux wraps a profile-defined prompt to retain
  cwd reporting, continues to disable PSReadLine predictions, and does not load
  profiles for health probes or other maintenance commands. Dynamic heartbeat
  registrations and legacy WSMan `powershell` machines do not support the flag.
- Host release labels use `v<wmux-version>-<platform>`, such as
  `v0.1.1-linux`, `v0.1.1-mac`, and `v0.1.1-win`. Local and Windows platforms
  are inferred; POSIX SSH defaults to `linux`, so set `"platform": "mac"` for
  a Mac SSH host.
- Set `WMUX_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for non-`*.ts.net` MagicDNS or proxy request
  hostnames. This does not expand the bind-address policy; use the narrowly
  scoped `WMUX_ALLOWED_BIND_RANGES` override for an unusual internal IP range.

Never commit machine inventories, credentials, tokens, private-key paths, or
personal service URLs. POSIX setup is covered in
[docs/POSIX_NODE_REGISTRATION.md](docs/POSIX_NODE_REGISTRATION.md), and Windows setup is covered in
[docs/WINDOWS_NODE_REGISTRATION.md](docs/WINDOWS_NODE_REGISTRATION.md).

When moving the service to another computer, do not copy a server-relative
`local` entry unchanged. Keep `local` for the new server and add the old server
as an explicit SSH machine if it should remain a target. See
[docs/SERVER_MIGRATION.md](docs/SERVER_MIGRATION.md) for the state, session,
stream, helper-credential, SSH host-key, and HTTPS cutover checklist.

### Keybindings

Keybindings are configured only in `wmux.config.json`. They are loaded when
wmux starts, so restart the service after changing them. If `keybindings` is
missing or empty, every current default remains active. A partial map replaces
only the named actions; omitted actions keep their defaults. Use an empty array
to disable one action:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "commandPalette.open": ["Ctrl+Shift+KeyP"],
    "sidebar.toggle": []
  }
}
```

Each chord uses exact modifiers followed by a layout-independent browser key
code. Supported modifiers are `Primary`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, and `Meta`;
`Primary` resolves to Command on Apple clients and Ctrl elsewhere. Common key
codes include `KeyK`, `Digit1`, `BracketLeft`, `Comma`, `Tab`, and
`ArrowLeft`. Extra modifiers do not match. Invalid chords, unknown actions,
duplicates, and bindings that collide in an active context prevent wmux from
starting instead of silently changing behavior.

Available actions are:

- System: `commandPalette.open`, `settings.open`, `settings.save`, and
  `sidebar.toggle`.
- Workspaces: `workspace.new`, `workspace.close`, `workspace.previous`,
  `workspace.next`, and `workspace.select1` through `workspace.select9`.
- Tabs: `tab.new`, `tab.close`, `tab.previous`, `tab.next`, and `tab.select1`
  through `tab.select9`.
- Panes and activity: `pane.splitRight`, `pane.splitDown`,
  `pane.focusPrevious`, `pane.focusNext`, and `notification.latestUnread`.
- Terminal handling: `terminal.insertNewline`, `terminal.wordPrevious`, and
  `terminal.wordNext`.

`settings.open` has no default because the former `Cmd+,` command-palette
label was not backed by an operative shortcut. Widget navigation such as Tab,
Enter, arrows, and Escape remains standard dialog behavior, and rectangular
selection remains an `Alt/Option+drag` mouse gesture.
Terminal copy and paste retain their fixed browser-aware shortcuts because
their clipboard event handling is not exposed as a configurable action.

### Dynamic host registration

Remote hosts can register by heartbeat instead of appearing in static config.
The server creates a separate catalog-write credential at
`~/.wmux/registration-token`. Provision these files on the remote host with
mode `0600`:

```text
~/.wmux/url
~/.wmux/registration-token
~/.wmux/heartbeat.json
```

```json
{
  "machine": {
    "id": "linux-box",
    "name": "Linux Box",
    "kind": "ssh",
    "user": "operator",
    "sessionBackend": "auto"
  },
  "ttlMs": 90000
}
```

```bash
scripts/wmux-heartbeat --once
scripts/install-heartbeat-service.sh
```

Native session-agent hosts send the same registration heartbeat from inside
the owning agent process. On POSIX, configure `~/.wmux/session-agent.json` and
run `scripts/install-session-agent-service.sh`. On Windows, configure
`~/.wmux/windows-agent.json` and run `wmux-windows-setup install-agent`.
There is no separate heartbeat task on either agent path. Installing or
starting the owning agent retires a legacy `wmux-heartbeat` task if one exists.
wmux always dials the validated heartbeat source address and removes agent
credentials from browser/status responses.
Registered panes do not receive the broad wmux API token, so API-posting helpers
need separately provisioned authorization.

## Authentication and Network Safety

> [!WARNING]
> Private binding, Host/Origin checks, and token authentication control access;
> they do not encrypt transport. Plain `http://` or `ws://` over an ordinary
> LAN can expose login passwords, bearer/session/registration/agent tokens,
> terminal input and output, clipboard contents, and media to an on-path
> observer, who may also be able to modify that traffic. Use HTTPS/WSS for
> browser-facing and cross-host traffic, or ensure every non-TLS leg is
> loopback or inside an encrypted tunnel. Direct traffic between Tailscale
> nodes is WireGuard-encrypted even when the application URL uses HTTP, but a
> subnet-routed leg may be plaintext after it leaves the Tailscale endpoint.

Within the private Host/Origin/bind boundary, only `/api/health`, auth metadata, password login, and the static login shell are public; all other application APIs and wmux WebSockets remain credential-gated.

- On first start, wmux creates `~/.wmux/token` and prints a one-time browser URL
  containing that token. Set `WMUX_TOKEN` or `WMUX_TOKEN_PATH` to supply one.
- Configure browser password login with
  `scripts/wmux-set-password --username you`.
  Login sessions last 30 days.
  In `shared-or-login` mode they remain signed compatibility tokens protected by `~/.wmux/session-secret`.
  In `login-only` mode the browser receives an opaque HttpOnly SameSite cookie and wmux persists its keyed digest plus bounded device, address, issue, expiry, and last-seen metadata in owner-only `~/.wmux/browser-sessions.json`.
  Settings lists these sessions and can revoke any device.
  Revocation immediately terminates every browser WebSocket owned by that session and rejects its next HTTP request.
  Set `WMUX_BROWSER_SESSION_PATH` to override that record path.
  Restart a running service with `systemctl --user restart wmux.service` after changing credentials; the helper prints this reminder after updating the credential file.
- `WMUX_DISABLE_AUTH=1` disables token checks only for deliberately isolated
  environments; it does not make public deployment supported.
- `WMUX_BROWSER_AUTH_MODE` defaults to `shared-or-login`, preserving existing shared-token URLs, `wmuxctl`, helpers, registration, and WebSockets.
  Upgrades create no scoped-token files and add no startup requirement.
  Set `WMUX_BROWSER_AUTH_MODE=login-only` only after provisioning valid password login credentials, a persistent session secret, and distinct automation and helper credentials; missing, malformed, unsafe, or duplicate credentials fail startup rather than downgrading.
- Provision scoped credentials without displaying them with `node scripts/wmux-provision-scoped-auth.mjs`.
  Provide `WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` / `WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN_PATH` and `WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN` / `WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN_PATH` (file form preferred).
  Use owner-only token files at the configured paths and never put credentials in arguments, logs, documentation, or URLs.
  Scoped credentials expire after 30 days by default.
  Set `WMUX_SCOPED_CREDENTIAL_TTL_MS` to an integer from one hour through 365 days to choose a different lifetime for newly discovered or rotated credentials.
  Settings shows issue and expiry times and can atomically rotate file-backed credentials without returning their values to the browser.
  An old value loses authority immediately and fails with `401`.
  Environment-backed credentials must be rotated through their external owner.
  Copies provisioned to remote hosts must still be distributed explicitly after rotation.
- Automation and helper credentials are distinct typed principals.
  Automation is limited to reviewed controller actions and pane-output WebSocket access; helper is limited to reviewed event, title, notification, media, clipboard, stream, and profile operations.
  Both use authorization headers only; scoped credentials are forbidden in query parameters and never fall back or retry across scopes.
  Registration remains separate.
- The browser must pass the password-session gate before bootstrap or browser WebSockets.
  In `login-only` mode the browser session is never returned to JavaScript, local storage, or a URL.
  REST and WebSocket requests authenticate through the HttpOnly SameSite cookie, with `Secure` added for direct TLS or an HTTPS `WMUX_PUBLIC_URL`.
  Session and scoped-credential controls change lifetime and revocation only; the existing exact-route authorities remain unchanged.
  Finer per-client capabilities remain deferred.
  wmux is not a public-Internet deployment.
- Use HTTPS away from loopback and treat every token as a password.
- Keep helper, clipboard, media, agent, and streaming endpoints behind the same
  private boundary. The Windows agent and Moonlight gateway use separate tokens.

### Repository working-tree snapshots

`POST /api/panes/:paneId/reviews` accepts exactly `{"kind":"working-tree"}` from a normally authenticated browser principal.
The server resolves the pane, local machine, current directory, and repository root from canonical server state.
The client cannot select a host, path, executable, shell command, or Git argument.

The response contains a content revision, HEAD revision when one exists, repository-relative file summaries, staged and unstaged tracked patches, and synthesized patches for bounded UTF-8 untracked files.
File summaries preserve rename, deletion, mode, binary, and submodule metadata while replacing unsafe or undecodable paths with stable non-reversible labels.
Ignored files are excluded.
Explicit response metadata reports file, patch-byte, hunk, line, long-line, per-file and aggregate untracked-content, Git-output, timeout, and consistency limits so a partial snapshot is never presented as complete.

Snapshot capture is read-only and local-only.
When an agent session is active for the pane, the snapshot is archived in the versioned owner-only timeline store and linked from the mobile Chat history.
Completed Codex and Claude sessions expose a read-only review action and a continue action through `POST /api/agent-sessions/:sessionId/turns`.
The server resolves the exact local repository root from the pane, supplies bounded durable session context to a headless runtime adapter, and keeps prompts out of process arguments.
Review always uses a read-only runtime mode and rejects write or unattended grants.
Continue treats write access and unattended approval as independent explicit grants.
OpenCode follow-up is disabled because its current headless CLI adapter cannot enforce the read-only boundary.
Remote repositories, native runtime resume identifiers, interactive headless approvals, Git fetches, credential operations, and Hunk/OpenTUI review remain deferred.
Automation, helper, registration, and registered-host credentials cannot access the route.

## Workspaces and Interaction

- Workspaces contain linked tabs and draggable split panes.
- The sidebar presents workspaces as nested branches.
  Branches can be collapsed or expanded, and their collapse state is synchronized by the server.
  Desktop, keyboard, and mobile controls support moving a workspace before, after, into, or out of another branch.
  Nesting is limited to four levels.
- Host filtering retains the ancestor context needed to understand matching workspaces; moves that would leave the active filter context are disabled.
  Workspace-number shortcuts follow the saved tree order, and newly created workspaces start at the top level.
- Closing a parent workspace promotes its children rather than killing their panes.
  Tree nesting is sidebar workspace metadata; tmux/screen durability remains owned by each pane.
- Agents using the bundled skill can create or reuse visible workspaces. These
  persist like user-created workspaces, appear with an `AI` badge, and retain
  direct links for monitoring or handoff.
- `/workspaces/:workspaceId/tabs/:tabId` opens a specific session directly.
- Workspace, tab, and pane selection are browser-local; terminal processes and
  notification read state remain server-owned.
- New same-host workspaces, tabs, and splits preserve the source pane's current
  directory through `tmux` metadata or OSC 7 reports.
- `wmux-title` updates generated titles without overwriting a manual title.
  Repeated identical updates are no-ops; while a workspace has multiple tabs, its first automatic workspace title stays stable and each eligible tab can keep its own automatic title.
- Host labels show the wmux release and platform consistently. Update
  indicators stay hidden unless an underlying runtime or helper update is
  needed.
- Settings persist in `~/.wmux/settings.json` and include an app-wide color scheme shared by terminal, canvas and DOM chrome, dialogs, and browser chrome; terminal font size, scrollback, user-facing host aliases, inactive-tab streaming, and terminal scroll mode.
- Fresh installs use the low-contrast Flock scheme, while the original wmux palette and the bundled terminal schemes remain available in Settings.
  Hidden cached tabs suspend terminal sockets by default while preserving their mounted terminal views; choose live streaming to retain the previous behavior.
  The terminal font family remains config-owned.
- New local, SSH, and Windows panes receive the selected scheme as `WMUX_COLOR_SCHEME` plus `WMUX_COLOR_MODE=dark|light`.
  The wmux server answers OSC 4/10/11 palette queries from the live scheme, including before a browser attaches and after a settings change.
  Programs that render explicit RGB colors still own those colors and are not recolored by the terminal palette.
  Windows panes also seed their isolated ConPTY color table from the selected scheme.
  The server-side VT checkpoint uses that same palette, so size-aware Windows replay preserves semantic default colors instead of repainting them black.
- Pasting a PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF into a connected terminal stages a private
  temporary file in that pane's target filesystem and pastes its quoted native
  path. Local, POSIX SSH, PowerShell-over-SSH, and current Windows-agent panes
  are supported; legacy WSMan, service, and custom-command targets fail closed.
  Images are limited to 8 MiB and expire after about one hour. Explicit pane
  close and discarded asynchronous pastes clean them up when the target remains
  reachable. A server or remote-host crash can leave a private file until the
  next opportunistic sweep (or manual cleanup under the per-user wmux runtime
  directory); stage paths are not persisted in workspace state.

Open the command palette with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` for navigation, host-scoped session
creation, splits, settings, diagnostics, activity, and session audit actions.
Diagnostics includes browser-local terminal latency percentiles for input
dispatch, predicted paint, sequence-acknowledged output, and Ghostty canvas
rendering. It separates normal-shell and alternate-screen/TUI samples, retains
no input text, and can copy or clear its bounded in-memory measurements.

### Keyboard shortcuts

These are the defaults. Override individual actions through the `keybindings`
map above without redefining the rest.

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Command palette | `Cmd/Ctrl+K` |
| New workspace | `Cmd/Ctrl+N` |
| New tab | `Cmd/Ctrl+T` |
| Toggle sidebar | `Cmd/Ctrl+B` |
| Split right | `Cmd/Ctrl+D` |
| Split down | `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D` |
| Close tab | `Cmd/Ctrl+W` |
| Close workspace | `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+W` |
| Workspace 1–8 / last | `Cmd/Ctrl+1–8` / `Cmd/Ctrl+9` |
| Tab 1–8 / last | `Alt+1–8` / `Alt+9` |
| Previous/next workspace | `Cmd+Ctrl+[` / `Cmd+Ctrl+]`; also `Ctrl+Alt+[` / `Ctrl+Alt+]` |
| Previous/next tab | `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+[` / `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+]`; also `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` / `Ctrl+Tab` |
| Previous/next word | `Option/Alt+Left/Right` |
| Insert terminal newline | `Shift+Enter` (sends `Ctrl+J` / LF) |
| Copy selected terminal text | `Cmd/Ctrl+C` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` |
| Paste terminal text/image | `Cmd/Ctrl+V` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V` |
| Rectangular terminal selection | `Alt/Option+drag`; use `Ctrl+Alt+drag` when a Linux window manager reserves `Alt+drag` |
| Focus neighboring pane | `Option+Cmd+Arrow` / `Alt+Ctrl+Arrow` |
| Latest unread notification | `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U` |

Browser- or OS-reserved shortcuts may not reach wmux on every platform.

## Helpers and Integrations

Local panes receive the repository's `scripts/` directory on `PATH`. SSH and
Windows panes stage matching helpers when a new pane starts.

| Helper | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `wmux-title` | Set generated or manual workspace/tab titles |
| `wmux-notify` | Create browser and terminal notifications |
| `wmux-agent-event` | Record agent lifecycle and response metadata |
| `wmux-run` | Track a command, duration, and exit status in Activity |
| `wmux-shell-run-event` | Internal staged reporter used by opt-in managed-shell hooks |
| `wmux-media` | Render images, audio, or video through the browser |
| `wmux-copy` / `wclip` | Hand text to the browser clipboard |
| `wmux-hooks` | Install Claude, Codex, OpenCode, or Prime Agent lifecycle hooks |
| `wmux-agent-input-broker` | Relay structured OpenCode questions and transient answers through a pane-scoped credential |
| `wmuxctl delegate` / `tui` | Run a visible one-shot task, a correlated durable Codex session turn, or an interactive OpenCode, Codex, Claude, or Prime Agent TUI |
| `wmux-agent-run` | Internal POSIX staged runner used by delegation and interactive TUI launch |
| `wmux-agent-profile` | Plan/apply agent profiles, add skills, and bootstrap pinned tools |
| `wmux-doctor` | Report host, pane, and durability health |

Examples:

### Agent lifecycle hooks

Staging the `wmux-hooks` and `wmux-agent-event` helper commands does not enable
agent integration by itself. Install hooks for each agent, on each host and user
account where that agent runs:

```bash
wmux-hooks install claude
wmux-hooks install codex
wmux-hooks install opencode
wmux-hooks install prime-agent
wmux-hooks status
```

Installed harness hooks silently no-op when the agent is launched outside a
wmux pane, so one global hook configuration can be shared across environments.

The Claude installer merges lifecycle commands into `~/.claude/settings.json`
and installs a small generated delegation skill at
`~/.claude/skills/wmux/SKILL.md`. An existing skill not marked as wmux-managed is
preserved instead of overwritten.
The Codex installer merges commands into `~/.codex/hooks.json`; start a new
Codex session, run `/hooks`, and review and trust the wmux command before
expecting events. Codex sandbox or approval settings do not replace this hook
trust step.

`wmux-hooks install opencode` writes an auto-loaded global TypeScript plugin to
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode/plugins/wmux.ts`; it does not modify
`opencode.json`. POSIX installation is supported; OpenCode's Windows installer
parity is not included.
An interactive OpenCode session rename appears in wmux on its next prompt;
wmux preserves a user-owned workspace title.

On POSIX, the generated OpenCode plugin can also project supported interactive
questions into a desktop browser shelf and return an answer through OpenCode's
typed question API without terminal typing. This integration is pinned to
OpenCode SDK `1.18.9`, fails closed on incompatible event/SDK shapes, and does
not retry a request generation after answer exposure; ambiguous delivery stays
quarantined for native reconciliation. A durable broker-owned occurrence stream
binds reused native request IDs to exact server generations; only a fully
validated top-level `question.list` snapshot can close absent requests. Snapshot
cuts, per-source request/byte quotas, monotonic backup recovery, and per-key
metadata FIFO prevent one stale or saturated source from advancing another
source's state. It does not replace the private-network
boundary. Setup, refresh, privacy, rollback,
and compatibility details are in
[OpenCode question compatibility](docs/OPENCODE_QUESTION_COMPATIBILITY.md).
Plugin/broker refresh can retain structured-question authority while the same
wmux backend attachment remains live. A wmux service restart deliberately
changes that authority epoch: durable terminal sessions still reattach, but the
old structured-question source is retired. Durable reattachment stages a fresh
pane capability; a surviving OpenCode broker waits with capped backoff,
re-registers without restarting OpenCode, and reconciles a complete native
question snapshot before structured answering resumes. Its owner-only durable
registration intent also converges repeated response loss or broker termination
after server commit without replaying relay plaintext from the server.

`wmux-hooks install prime-agent` writes an auto-loaded managed extension to `~/.prime/agent/extensions/wmux.ts`.
While a root turn or any nested RLM subagent is running, the pane's sidebar row uses the animated working indicator.
When a Prime session is idle with an active scheduled heartbeat, that row uses a distinct red heart pulse.
A delivered heartbeat turn switches back to the ordinary blue working spinner until its work finishes, then returns to the heart while the schedule remains active.
Root completion is deferred until the last descendant becomes idle, then the row changes to Done without a false idle flicker.
Intermediate tool-loop ends that trigger auto-compaction retain the same running lifecycle through Prime's internal continuation.
Temporary provider failures likewise retain the active run while Prime backs off and retries; a recovered attempt returns to ordinary Working without leaving the sidebar stuck on a provisional failure.
Prime's internal session name is canonical for automatically owned wmux titles: initial and contextual naming update Prime first, while `/name` changes are mirrored to wmux even while the session is idle. In a shared container, the first layout pane owns its tab title and the first tab's first layout pane owns the workspace title; other split Prime sessions remain pane-scoped and cannot overwrite those shared names. Ownership transfers deterministically when the owner pane or tab closes. Manual wmux workspace or tab titles remain user-owned and are not overwritten.
The gold `?` indicator is reserved for a positively identified explicit input request; the managed Prime Agent extension does not guess that ordinary idle completion requires input.
New POSIX pane processes export `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, `HERDR_TAB_ID`, and `HERDR_PANE_ID` compatibility aliases because Prime Agent 0.7.1 forwards only that allowlist into each daemon session scope; wmux deliberately does not set `HERDR_ENV` or a Herdr socket.
Daemon workers never trust their ambient environment for routing: the extension accepts the explicit HERDR tuple in the owner-only worker descriptor, or an owner-created migration sidecar for an env-less legacy descriptor, after validating the worker PID, root active-session ID, and root session ID. It fails closed when proof is absent or malformed. Only non-daemon processes may use a complete HERDR tuple and then fall back to one complete `WMUX_*` tuple.
Prime creates its persistent IPython kernel before applying the daemon session exec environment, so the extension pins proven W/T/P IDs into Python and `%%bash` tool calls and clears every stale W/T/P variable when daemon proof is unavailable; wmux commands therefore cannot inherit the daemon's launch pane.
A resident Prime session stays bound to its creator pane; reopening a nonresident saved session can bind it to the new pane.
Existing pane shells must be recreated after rollout to receive the compatibility aliases.
The installer preserves an unmanaged extension already present at that path.
Prime Agent is also recognized by the mobile Chat surface, can be started there, and is supported by `wmuxctl delegate` and `wmuxctl tui` on POSIX targets.

`wmuxctl delegate` provides visible one-shot delegation for OpenCode, Codex, Claude, and Prime Agent on POSIX local/SSH targets.
It also provides durable interactive Codex delegation on Windows PowerShell-over-SSH targets.
Adding `--session` selects a persistent Codex TUI on either POSIX or Windows instead of the one-shot JSON runner.
The first session turn returns its `workspaceId`; pass that value back with `--session-workspace` so later turns reuse the exact agent process without depending on a title.
Every turn receives a new lifecycle run ID and returns the native assistant response recorded by the installed Codex hooks.
Session mode deliberately rejects `--structured-outcome` and `--close-on-success` because the conversation, not a JSON envelope or disposable process, is the durable abstraction.
It accepts the prompt from a file or stdin, records lifecycle events, and returns a bounded result plus the direct workspace URL.
POSIX delegation creates a fresh durable workspace and starts the staged `wmux-agent-run` transport.
When a non-empty `WMUX_PANE_ID` is available, a newly created agent workspace is nested beneath the invoking wmux workspace; this uses the explicit pane context rather than title heuristics. This applies to `delegate`, `tui`, and the shared `open`, `run`, and `ps` workspace commands. Reused workspaces retain their existing parent, while `--new` creates a nested child. Calls outside wmux, or with an empty variable, remain root workspaces. Parent validation errors are returned without falling back to a root workspace.
Windows delegation starts a normal Codex TUI and submits the prompt through bracketed paste after the TUI is ready.
A later Windows delegation with the same machine and exact title reuses that idle Codex session while assigning the new turn its own run ID.
The helper rejects concurrent delegation to a titled session that is already running work.
Delegated agent hooks associate each prompt and final response with the controller's active run ID.
wmux maintains a dedicated delegation ledger separately from workspace activity, so an outcome remains queryable after its pane or workspace closes.
Each session also has a durable turn timeline containing its prompts, state changes, outcomes, and links to working-tree snapshots captured through the repository review API.
Query `GET /api/agent-sessions/:sessionId` for that history.
Post `{"action":"review"}` to `POST /api/agent-sessions/:sessionId/turns` for a read-only local working-tree review.
Post `{"action":"continue","prompt":"...","writeAccess":false,"unattended":false}` to start a new headless turn with bounded context from the same durable session.
Write access and unattended approval default false and are never inferred from one another.
The mobile Chat surface renders matching sessions directly from this timeline, so it can restore complete conversation history without attaching the terminal pane.
The Agent Fleet surface is available from the command palette and mobile header.
It orders approval, login, blocked, and input-required sessions first, then shows every active or actionable delegation's runtime, retained host identity, state age, and latest durable timeline entry.
`wmuxctl` races terminal replay against the authenticated delegation-status endpoint, allowing either completion signal to finish the request without waiting for the other to time out.
Controller observation failures are recorded separately and never replace an agent's terminal outcome.
`--mode review`, `--mode change`, and `--mode deploy` select the configured wait profile.
When omitted, `wmuxctl` selects review without `--write-access` and change with `--write-access`.
`--timeout` is a per-dispatch controller wait override from 0.1 through 14,400 seconds.
It does not limit agent runtime or grant process control.
The OpenCode `wmux_delegate` tool accepts `mode: "change" | "deploy"` and the same bounded `timeout_seconds` override.
OpenCode cannot enforce read-only delegation, so its tool does not expose review mode.
For example:

```bash
wmuxctl delegate codex linux-box --directory /srv/project \
  --prompt-file /tmp/task.md --title "Review authentication"
wmuxctl delegate codex linux-box --directory /srv/project \
  --prompt-file /tmp/first-turn.md --title "Authentication workstream" \
  --session --accept-trust --sandbox danger-full-access
wmuxctl delegate codex linux-box --directory /srv/project \
  --prompt-file /tmp/follow-up.md --title "Implement review findings" \
  --session --session-workspace ws_example --sandbox danger-full-access
wmuxctl delegate claude linux-box --directory /srv/project \
  --prompt-file /tmp/fix.md --title "Fix authentication" --write-access \
  --mode change
wmuxctl delegate prime-agent linux-box --directory /srv/project \
  --prompt-file /tmp/prime-task.md --title "Implement authentication" \
  --write-access --unattended --mode change
wmuxctl delegate codex windows-box --directory 'T:\git\example\project' \
  --prompt-file /tmp/import.md --title "Import catalog" --write-access \
  --sandbox danger-full-access --structured-outcome --mode deploy
```

Codex defaults to its read-only sandbox and Claude defaults to plan permission mode.
`--write-access` opts into Codex workspace writes or Claude accepted edits; it does not bypass approval prompts.
OpenCode and Prime Agent cannot enforce a comparable read-only mode, so their delegation requires explicit `--write-access`.
`--unattended` separately opts into non-interactive execution and should only be used for work explicitly authorized on a trusted target.
Prime Agent has no approval prompt or approval-bypass CLI setting, so its one-shot runtime requires both acknowledgements, does not map `--unattended` to `--autonomous`, and runs `--mode json --no-session` with its prompt on stdin.
For OpenCode, the staged runner probes the installed CLI and uses its advertised `--auto` or `--dangerously-skip-permissions` option, failing closed if neither is available.
Prompts are sent through pane stdin rather than shell arguments and are redacted from returned terminal output.
`--sandbox danger-full-access` disables Codex filesystem and network sandboxing without enabling the separate unattended approval option.
`--structured-outcome` requires Codex to report `completed`, `blocked`, or `failed` with a summary, so a normal process exit cannot turn blocked work into a successful result.

Delegations leave their durable workspace open by default.
Session mode preserves the Codex conversation for later turns that name its exact returned workspace ID.
`--close-on-success` (`close_on_success` in the OpenCode tool) closes only after a successful result and completed lifecycle event.
If the controller wait expires or pane output becomes unreadable after submission, the controller records `observer_error` and `waiting`, returns the run and workspace identifiers, and leaves the worker untouched.
The controller does not send Ctrl-C or close the workspace on observation loss.
An installed worker hook can later reconcile the same run to success or worker failure through the durable ledger, including after a controller or wmux restart.
The first worker terminal outcome wins, so repeated or conflicting completion notices cannot duplicate notifications or regress the record.
Agent notifications are emitted from lifecycle transitions for attention and terminal states.
Budget alerts include the durable timeline entry that put the agent into its current state.
Query `GET /api/delegations/:runId` to reconcile a detached run.
Failed, stopped, waiting, and controller-detached workspaces remain available for inspection.
The permission-gated `wmux_close` tool accepts `workspace_id` to explicitly close a workspace later, but refuses anything not recorded as agent-created.
The generated plugin defaults both `wmux_delegate` and `wmux_close` permissions to `ask` in memory without rewriting `opencode.json`; an explicit per-tool OpenCode permission of `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` takes precedence.
Explicit cancellation sends Ctrl-C, but a disconnected or wedged remote pane may require manual recovery.
Restart OpenCode after installing or updating the plugin so it loads the generated tools.

`wmuxctl tui` starts the real interactive CLI in a fresh POSIX local/SSH pane, with its working directory set by the staged helper. When invoked inside a wmux pane, the new workspace nests beneath that pane; outside wmux it remains a root workspace. Prime Agent launches with `--no-session` so the supervised pane, rather than its background daemon, owns the visible process.
It leaves every workspace open and intentionally creates no manual lifecycle event (installed hooks own interactive turns).
Prompts are read only from a UTF-8 file or stdin; they never appear in argv or the launch JSON.
Prompt text may contain ordinary Unicode, tabs, and LF newlines; CRLF is normalized to LF, while other C0/C1 controls, including ESC, bare CR, and DEL, are rejected before workspace creation.
The helper resolves the runtime executable before changing directory, emits a unique launch marker, and waits for an exact controller ACK before starting the terminal-attached child.
The controller then requires fresh child output and continuously observes startup for safety gates for five seconds by default before sending one bracketed paste and a separate Enter.
Copy-paste examples:

```bash
wmuxctl tui opencode linux-box --directory /srv/project --no-prompt
wmuxctl tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md
printf '%s' 'Review the current change.' | wmuxctl tui claude linux-box --directory /srv/project
wmuxctl tui prime-agent linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md
cat /tmp/task.md | wmuxctl tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file -
wmuxctl tui opencode linux-box --directory /srv/project --no-prompt --accept-trust
wmuxctl tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --no-prompt --gate-timeout 8
wmuxctl --public-url https://wmux.example.internal tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --no-prompt
```

Repository-trust/first-run gates fail closed by default while leaving the pane open.
After reviewing the exact prompt, `--accept-trust` answers only a recognized repository-trust screen that offers numbered choice `1` as yes/trust/continue; it sends `1` and Enter in separate input requests.
Other trust layouts, generic onboarding, login, and credential prompts are never answered.
Detection is intentionally conservative and may leave a new or changed runtime's first-run screen open for manual handling.
`--gate-timeout` is the positive finite startup-observation interval: increasing it adds equal startup latency but catches later gates.
No upstream CLI exposes a common deterministic readiness signal, so an unrecognized gate that appears only after this bounded interval, or uses an entirely novel layout outside the conservative classifiers, remains a bounded residual risk; the default reduces but cannot eliminate that upstream-readiness race.

`wmux-agent-run tui` remains the foreground supervisor after launch.
If the runtime exits, it emits `WMUX_AGENT_TUI_EXIT <runId> <code>` and discards input instead of returning it to the shell, preventing a racing task prompt from becoming a shell command.
Press Ctrl-C in that pane to return to the shell after an early runtime exit; the exact administrative release line is `WMUX_AGENT_TUI_RELEASE <runId>`.
JSON includes local and configured public handoff URLs.
Set `WMUX_PUBLIC_URL` (or `--public-url`) to an absolute credential-free `http://` or `https://` base URL without a query or fragment; otherwise the API URL is used for both.
An intentional path prefix is preserved.
`localUrl` is derived from the API base URL actually used by the caller; it is not a fabricated loopback address.
`url` prefers `publicUrl`, which falls back to `localUrl` when no public base is configured.

The older `wmux-opencode-run` helper remains staged for compatibility with existing integrations.
New POSIX callers should use `wmux-agent-run` through `wmuxctl delegate`.

On Windows, run `wmux-windows-setup install-hooks`, then review and trust the command with `/hooks` in a new Codex session.
Dynamically registered hosts do not receive broad wmux API credentials; lifecycle hooks on those hosts require separately provisioned API authentication or event posts fail with `401`.

OpenCode's semantic Copy action and Codex's `/copy` command can write through OSC 52. wmux accepts
canonical UTF-8 writes to the `c` clipboard selection (`ESC ] 52 ; c ; base64`) and tmux's empty
default selection (`ESC ] 52 ; ; base64`) up to 1 MiB, removes every OSC 52 request from terminal
rendering, and never sends or persists its payload. Reconnect replay never writes the clipboard. Live
requests write automatically only in the focused foreground pane during a browser user activation;
otherwise the newest request is available as **Copy terminal request** in that pane's toolbar for 60 seconds.

The bundled Codex skill lives in `skills/wmux`:

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
ln -sfnT "$(pwd)/skills/wmux" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/wmux"
```

Personal agent instructions and skills can live in a private
`../wmux-agent-profile` peer directory and be applied conservatively when a new
pane starts. See [Agent profiles](docs/AGENT_PROFILES.md) and the sanitized
[`examples/wmux-agent-profile`](examples/wmux-agent-profile).

Remote helper commands are staged when a new pane starts; existing shells are
not retrofitted automatically, and agent hooks still require the explicit setup
above.

## Experimental Windows Session Agent

Plain PowerShell-over-SSH panes do not survive a wmux service restart. The
optional Windows agent owns pane processes and replay independently:

```powershell
wmux-windows-setup install-deps
wmux-windows-setup install-agent
wmux-windows-setup configure-agent-firewall <wmux-server-internal-ip>
wmux-windows-setup agent-status
```

The default task uses `Interactive` logon when a desktop session exists and `S4U` on a headless host.
To start before UI login while retaining the user's authenticated network credentials, opt into Task Scheduler password logon from an interactive private shell:

```powershell
wmux-windows-setup install-agent --logon-type Password
```

The password is prompted locally and retained only by Windows Task Scheduler; wmux does not put it in configuration, helper files, environment variables, or command arguments.
Password mode pre-registers the base task, eight dormant rollout slots, and the update watcher so later automatic updates never need to recover the credential.
After changing the Windows account password, close any active agent panes and run `wmux-windows-setup refresh-agent-credentials`.

When `~/.wmux/url`, `registration-token`, and `heartbeat.json` are present, the
base agent heartbeats automatically and reports its last success/failure in
`/health`. Adjacent-port rollout generations never heartbeat, preventing two
agent processes from racing the same registry record.

Opt in from the machine's untracked config:

```json
{
  "id": "windows-box",
  "kind": "powershell-ssh",
  "host": "100.64.0.30",
  "user": "operator",
  "sessionBackend": "agent",
  "agentPort": 3481,
  "agentToken": "replace-with-a-long-random-token",
  "loadPowerShellProfile": true
}
```

Generate `agentToken` with `openssl rand -hex 32` and add it before the first SSH bootstrap pane so the staged listener is protected from its first start.
When the SSH `host` is a DNS name, also set `agentUrl` to the target's explicit private/internal IPv4 address and port, for example `"agentUrl": "http://100.64.0.30:3481"`.
The current agent listener intentionally refuses hostname, IPv6, and public-address binds; `agentPort` must match the port in `agentUrl`.

Managed configs use `backend: "auto"`: ConPTY is preferred and terminal-safe stdio is the fallback when `pywinpty` is unavailable.
Existing explicit `"conpty"` or `"stdio"` values remain pinned.
When the base agent is outdated and idle, new pane creation stages the update and safely restarts that base before attaching.
If the base still owns panes, wmux instead starts a side-by-side agent generation; existing panes remain pinned to the agent that owns them, and generation ports are persisted so wmux restarts reconnect each pane correctly.
Password-backed rollout retirement leaves its dormant, credentialed task slot registered while removing the generation config; full uninstall removes every task and its Task Scheduler credential.
The Windows agent cannot preserve pane processes across a Windows reboot.
When the agent returns without a previously live session, wmux recreates that pane ID once as a fresh shell at its last known cwd and dimensions, clears the stale terminal screen, and resumes polling instead of repeating `unknown_session` forever.
The firewall must allow the configured `agentPort` and the next eight ports from the wmux server (for the default, `3481-3489`); `configure-agent-firewall` installs that exact-source, bounded rule and requires an elevated PowerShell session.
A pane shows rollout progress while its generation starts.
Changing `loadPowerShellProfile` affects only newly created pane processes; reattaching an existing agent-owned pane does not rerun its profile.

For a manual in-place restart after the agent becomes idle, use:

```powershell
wmux-windows-agent-service activate-update
```

The in-place path accepts sessions while the update is pending, enters a brief
hard drain only after it becomes idle, and then restarts. A forced agent
restart still terminates its pane processes. See the
[Windows registration runbook](docs/WINDOWS_NODE_REGISTRATION.md) for setup and
validation.

## POSIX Session Agent

Linux and macOS can run the native `wmux-session-agent` under systemd user
services or launchd. It owns a real PTY, bounded replay, resize history, staged
paste files, the optional dynamic-registration heartbeat, and on-demand screen-capture supervision.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.wmux
chmod 700 ~/.wmux
python3 -c 'import json,secrets; print(json.dumps({"host":"127.0.0.1","port":3481,"token":secrets.token_urlsafe(32),"backend":"pty"}, indent=2))' > ~/.wmux/session-agent.json
chmod 600 ~/.wmux/session-agent.json
scripts/install-session-agent-service.sh
```

For a remote machine, bind the agent to its exact Tailscale or private address,
allow the configured port only from the wmux server, and copy the generated
token into that machine's untracked wmux configuration.

```json
{
  "id": "linux-agent-box",
  "kind": "ssh",
  "platform": "linux",
  "host": "100.64.0.21",
  "user": "operator",
  "sessionBackend": "agent",
  "agentPort": 3481,
  "agentToken": "replace-with-the-agent-token"
}
```

The process is independent of the wmux service, so an agent-owned pane survives
a wmux restart even if `tmux` and `screen` are unavailable.
Explicit pane closure deletes the owned process.
An unexpected session-agent restart still terminates its child processes.
See the [POSIX registration runbook](docs/POSIX_NODE_REGISTRATION.md) for static
and dynamic setup, network restrictions, and validation.

An unused side-by-side generation can be retired without risking live panes:

```powershell
wmux-windows-agent-service retire-generation --port 3482
```

The helper refuses the base port, unreachable generations, and generations
with active sessions. It enters a hard drain and rechecks the session count
before removing the generation's Scheduled Task, process, config, and wrapper.

## Persistence

wmux stores workspace layout in `~/.wmux/state.json` using versioned, atomic,
owner-only writes with a rolling validated backup.
The same state file retains the newest 1,000 delegation records, expires terminal outcomes after 30 days, and keeps active outcomes until they become terminal or fall outside the count bound.
Delegation records are independent of pane and workspace cleanup.
Agent turn history is stored separately in `~/.wmux/agent-timelines.json` with the same schema-versioned, atomic, owner-only, rolling-backup discipline.
Set `WMUX_AGENT_TIMELINE_PATH` to override that location.
Working-tree snapshots linked from a timeline are archived as owner-only versioned files under `~/.wmux/repository-snapshots/`.
Each pane's current VT screen is stored under `~/.wmux/pane-checkpoints/` as a bounded, versioned, owner-only ANSI checkpoint with an atomic rolling backup.
Set `WMUX_TERMINAL_CHECKPOINT_DIR` to override that directory.
Registered panes, configured remote durable multiplexers, and configured session-agent panes persist their server-only disposal endpoints in `~/.wmux/session-endpoints.json` with the same schema-versioned, atomic, owner-only, rolling-backup discipline.
Set `WMUX_SESSION_ENDPOINT_PATH` to override that location.
The ledger can retain multiple endpoints for one pane when a dynamic machine ID is reassigned, and it is never included in browser bootstrap state.
When an endpoint no longer belongs to persisted workspace state, wmux reconciles the exact recorded endpoint and removes its owned session automatically once the endpoint is reachable.

| Backend | Survives browser refresh | Survives wmux restart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local/SSH `auto`, `tmux`, or `screen` | Yes | Yes |
| POSIX session agent | Yes | Yes, while the agent remains running |
| Raw PTY | Yes | No |
| Plain PowerShell-over-SSH | Yes | No |
| Windows session agent | Yes | Yes, while the agent remains running |

Each live pane also has bounded in-memory raw replay for scrollback-preserving reconnects.
The current VT screen checkpoint is persisted on a debounce and restored as the attach shield after a wmux restart for every backend that declares checkpoint persistence.
This restores screen state only.
Raw PTY and legacy PowerShell processes remain non-durable, scrollback transcripts remain intentionally unpersisted, and durable multiplexers still redraw from their live session after wmux reattaches.
Native session agents record byte-exact resize boundaries so live replay can replace the restored shield at the correct dimensions.

Explicitly closing a pane, tab, or workspace kills its backing session.
Audit local multiplexer sessions plus registered-host multiplexer and native-agent sessions with:

```bash
npm run audit:sessions
npm run audit:sessions -- --json
```

The Settings audit identifies each registered endpoint and reports unreachable hosts separately.
It can remove confirmed duplicate or orphan wmux sessions but never active or non-wmux sessions.
Remote cleanup uses the persisted server-only endpoint snapshot, so dynamic ID reassignment cannot redirect cleanup to the replacement host.

## Screen Streaming

wmux uses one agent-owned path for on-demand, view-only capture.
The native POSIX or Windows agent supervises `wmux-stream-agent`, which publishes RTSP to private MediaMTX only while a browser holds a lease.
MediaMTX provides browser WebRTC playback.
The separate Moonlight/Sunshine gateway remains only for Moonlight-native interactive streaming.

```bash
scripts/install-stream-service.sh
scripts/install-session-agent-service.sh
```

On Windows, use `wmux-windows-setup install-agent`.
The agent restarts a failed capture worker with bounded backoff and retires the former standalone capture supervisor during installation.
Capture still runs only while a browser holds a stream lease.
Keep RTSP, WebRTC, and gateway ports on the private interface.
See [docs/STREAMING.md](docs/STREAMING.md) for the per-platform setup and transport decision.
See [docs/MOONLIGHT_GATEWAY.md](docs/MOONLIGHT_GATEWAY.md) for Moonlight/Sunshine setup and security notes.

## Mobile

Phone-sized and short touch viewports use dedicated controls for navigation, Chat, Term, and commands.
The workspace drawer includes tabs and split panes; only the active split is shown in the terminal area.
Mobile overlays use scrollable semantic controls, safe-area insets, and 44px touch targets.
Chrome collapses while the software keyboard is open without destroying the active terminal session.
A pane opens in Chat when it has recent agent context and in Term otherwise; an explicit choice is remembered for that pane in the current browser tab.
While the terminal keyboard is open, a compact Paste/Esc/Tab/Ctrl/arrow row supplies clipboard access and keys that phone keyboards commonly omit.
Paste reads clipboard text directly when the browser permits it and otherwise opens a manual paste field for HTTP and restricted mobile browsers.
Explicit pane, tab, and workspace closes require confirmation before their backing sessions are killed.

The web app manifest and owned home-screen icons support standalone installation without changing the private-network deployment boundary.

The Chat surface displays trusted structured agent events, not parsed PTY output.
Live terminal progress remains in Term view.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check
npm run test:e2e
```

- `npm run check` runs unit/integration tests, both TypeScript checks, helper syntax validation, and the production build.
- `npm run test:e2e` exercises desktop Chromium plus phone-sized Chromium and WebKit against an isolated loopback-only service.
- `npm run test:e2e:chromium` is the faster browser subset.
- `npm run test:e2e:server` runs specs that require the Playwright driver and fixture service to share a checkout and filesystem.
- `npm run test:e2e:browser` runs the complementary browser-only group, which can use a fixture service on another trusted private-network host.
- `WMUX_E2E_SERVER_HOST=<private-ip> WMUX_E2E_TOKEN=<per-run-secret> npm run test:e2e:serve` exposes an authenticated isolated fixture service to a trusted private-network runner. The runner uses the same `WMUX_E2E_TOKEN` with `WMUX_E2E_BASE_URL=http://<private-ip>:3491`; external runs fail closed unless the token is 32–512 printable ASCII characters without spaces. Browser storage authenticates the wmux page, origin-targeted API request contexts carry the bearer, and tracing is disabled to keep that ephemeral credential out of artifacts.
- Keep the two groups on separate fixture-service instances so concurrent state mutations remain isolated.

## Current Limitations

- wmux is single-user and private-network only.
- Native session agents do not preserve processes across their own unexpected
  or forced restart. Windows automatic staged updates wait for active panes to
  close.
- Dynamic registered panes need separately provisioned auth for helpers that
  post back to wmux.
- Kitty graphics supports direct, file, temporary-file, and POSIX shared-memory
  transfers with native z-index and scrollback-aware placement.
  Kitty animation, Sixel, iTerm2 images, and Windows named shared memory remain
  unsupported and produce a visible diagnostic.
  See [Terminal graphics](docs/TERMINAL_GRAPHICS.md).
