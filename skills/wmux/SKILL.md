# wmux

## Purpose

Use wmux when a task should run on a specific private-network machine with a visible browser terminal surface, durable local/SSH panes, wmux activity metadata, or helper commands such as `wmux-run`, `wmux-notify`, `wmux-copy`, and `wmux-agent-event`.

Prefer direct local tools or SSH only for quick invisible checks. Prefer wmux when the user asks to orchestrate remote work, wants to monitor the task in the browser, the task spans machines, or the command should remain attached to a wmux workspace.

## Capabilities

- Discover configured and dynamically registered machines, including reachability and backend health.
- Create or reuse visible agent-generated workspaces and tabs on local, SSH, or Windows targets. These persist with `createdBy: "agent"`, appear with an `AI` badge, and can be handed to the user with a direct URL.
- Send shell input, run short PowerShell scripts, inspect replay, and wait for output or completion sentinels.
- Record command and agent lifecycle metadata, post browser notifications, and automatically close successful one-shot workspaces.
- Give one-shot agent workspaces a bounded 24-hour fallback lifetime so controller loss, missing terminal events, and broken remote sessions cannot strand them indefinitely.

## First Steps

1. Read live machine state from `/api/bootstrap` before acting. Static machines come from the configured `wmux.config.json`; dynamic hosts come from the heartbeat registry. `WMUX_URL`, `~/.wmux/url`, and finally `http://127.0.0.1:3478` select the API.
2. Use `references/api-and-machines.md` when you need exact endpoints, machine ids, or setup caveats.
3. Use `scripts/wmuxctl.py` for common API actions:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py machines
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py open linux-box --title "Build check"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tabs --machine windows-box --title "Runner repair"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py output pane_abc123 --tail-chars 8000
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py wait pane_abc123 --pattern "ready|task_complete" --timeout 30
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py run windows-box --title "Windows smoke" --line "wmux-run -- pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command '$PSVersionTable.PSVersion'"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py delegate codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md --title "Review auth"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py delegate prime-agent linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md --write-access --unattended
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md
printf '%s' 'Review auth.' | python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tui claude linux-box --directory /srv/project
cat /tmp/task.md | python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tui codex linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file -
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tui opencode linux-box --directory /srv/project --no-prompt --accept-trust
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tui prime-agent linux-box --directory /srv/project --prompt-file /tmp/task.md
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py ps windows-box --title "Runner repair" --script "Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName build-runner" --wait
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py finish --machine windows-box --title "Runner repair" --status completed --summary "Runner repaired" --close
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py cleanup --workspace ws_failed --workspace ws_superseded
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py send pane_abc123 --line "wmux-agent-event --agent codex --status completed --title Done --summary 'Remote step finished'"
```

The helper reads `WMUX_URL`/`~/.wmux/url` and prefers `WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`/`WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN_PATH`; compatibility mode may use `WMUX_TOKEN`/`~/.wmux/token`.
Scoped credentials are header-only, never printed or placed in query parameters, and are never retried with the legacy token after rejection.
If the saved URL still points at the old HTTP service, update `~/.wmux/url` or pass the current HTTPS URL explicitly.

## Naming the Current Session

Inside an existing wmux pane, use its bound environment as the source of truth. Do not inspect `/api/bootstrap`, search the API, or infer a "current" browser pane just to name the session.

Automatic Prime root-session naming needs no tool call.
The lifecycle hook names the Prime session and mirrors it to the bound automatic workspace/tab title on the first prompt, re-publishes it on later root turns, and refreshes an extension-owned name from the latest context recap after every six additional root turns.
In a multi-tab workspace, the first automatic workspace title stays stable while each bound tab can keep its own refreshed title.
Manual Prime or wmux names remain user-owned; use the commands below only when the user asks for a manual name or the task requires an explicit label.

Name the current workspace:

```bash
wmux-title --manual \
  --workspace "$WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID" \
  --title "Descriptive workspace name"
```

Name the current tab separately:

```bash
wmuxctl tab-title \
  --workspace "$WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID" \
  --tab "$WMUX_TAB_ID" \
  --tab-title "Descriptive tab name"
```

To name both, run both commands. `wmux-title --manual` changes the workspace only; passing `--tab` to it does not rename the tab. Never copy IDs from another pane. If the required `WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`, `WMUX_TAB_ID`, and `WMUX_PANE_ID` identity is missing or malformed, fail closed and ask for a newly created wmux pane rather than guessing from global state. A successful manual title becomes user-owned and is not replaced by later automatic prompt naming.

## Operating Rules

- Treat wmux as live infrastructure. Creating workspaces is usually safe; closing panes, tabs, or workspaces kills the matching session and must be intentional.
- Do not expose bearer tokens in final answers, logs, code, or committed files.
- Honor the current repository and host instructions.
- Do not weaken wmux bind, Host/Origin, token, CORS, or helper-staging protections.
- For Windows machines reached from a non-Windows wmux server, use `kind: "powershell-ssh"` behavior. Do not switch to legacy WSMan `powershell` unless explicitly debugging that path.
- Let normal pane creation roll outdated Windows agents onto a side-by-side generation; existing panes remain pinned to their owning generation. Use `wmux-windows-agent-service activate-update` only for a manual in-place restart at idle, and never use `restart --force` unless terminating every active agent-owned pane is explicitly intended.
- Check `/api/bootstrap` for `reachable`, `reason`, and `backendDetail` before assuming a machine is ready. Windows status includes helper, stream, Python/FFmpeg, and agent health probes.
- Use exact machine ids from `/api/bootstrap`; it merges static config with the dynamic heartbeat registry. Do not rely on stale docs if the live API differs.
- Registered panes intentionally lack the broad `WMUX_TOKEN`. Before relying on `wmux-notify`, `wmux-run`, media, clipboard, or agent hooks there, verify that separate normal/scoped helper auth was provisioned; otherwise those helpers return `401`.
- Helpers prefer `WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN`/`WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN_PATH`; POSIX and Windows staging follow the same rule. Never use automation auth as helper fallback.
- Always give automated work a descriptive `--title`; `wmuxctl open`, `run`, and `ps` reuse an existing workspace with that exact title by default. Use `--new` only when a genuinely separate workspace is wanted.
- Agent-created workspaces are disposable by default and receive a 24-hour fallback expiry even when a caller omits cleanup fields.
  Use `--retain-workspace` only for deliberately long-lived `open`, `run`, or `ps` workspaces.
  Interactive `tui` and durable `delegate --session` workspaces send an explicit retain policy.
- Treat visibility as a contract. If the user asked for visible work, start substantive and long-lived processes in the wmux pane, not through direct SSH. Direct SSH remains appropriate for quick diagnostics only.
- Prefer `wmuxctl delegate` for a visible one-shot OpenCode, Codex, Claude, or Prime Agent task, or add `--session` for a durable Codex conversation on POSIX or Windows.
  Pass the prompt through `--prompt-file` or stdin, never as a shell argument.
  One-shot POSIX delegation creates a fresh agent-owned workspace and waits for the staged runner.
  Session mode starts a normal Codex TUI and returns its workspace ID; pass that ID with `--session-workspace` for every later turn.
  Each session turn gets a distinct lifecycle run ID, and a busy session rejects concurrent delegation.
  Session mode returns the native assistant response and therefore rejects `--structured-outcome` and `--close-on-success`.
  The helper returns the direct URL and bounded final result on both paths.
- Delegation completion races terminal replay against the durable lifecycle ledger.
  Review mode waits 30 minutes by default, while change and deploy modes wait two hours.
  `--timeout` is a bounded controller wait override, not a worker runtime limit.
  A watcher timeout or post-submit pane-read failure returns `state: waiting` with `failureKind: observer`, retains the workspace and run ID, and does not send Ctrl-C.
  Inspect the retained workspace or `GET /api/delegations/:runId` before retrying destructive work.
  Use Ctrl-C only for explicit cancellation.
- Use `wmuxctl tui` for an interactive POSIX OpenCode, Codex, Claude, or Prime Agent session. It starts the real terminal-attached TUI through the staged foreground supervisor, keeps the workspace open, and does not create manual lifecycle events. A TUI invoked inside wmux nests under the invoking pane; outside wmux it creates a root workspace. Without `--title`, its workspace remains automatic-owned so the runtime lifecycle can replace the generated name; `--title` is an explicit persistent manual name. Use `--prompt-file PATH`, `--prompt-file -`, piped stdin, or deliberate `--no-prompt`; prompts are bracketed-pasted only after the launch ACK, fresh child output, and the bounded `--gate-timeout` observation (five seconds by default). Repository trust fails closed unless the reviewed invocation adds `--accept-trust`, which answers only a recognized numbered `1` yes/trust/continue choice using separate text and Enter requests, then repeats the observation. Login, credentials, generic onboarding, and unknown first-run screens are never automated. If the runtime exits early, input is quarantined; manual Ctrl-C returns to the shell. `localUrl` uses the caller's API base; `url` prefers the configured `publicUrl`, which otherwise falls back to local.
- Keep write access and unattended execution separate. Omit `--write-access` for Codex read-only or Claude plan mode; add it only when repository edits are intended. OpenCode and Prime Agent have no enforceable read-only adapter and therefore require explicit `--write-access`. Prime Agent also requires explicit `--unattended` because it has no approval prompts; this acknowledgement does not enable its unrelated `--autonomous` continuation mode.
- One-shot delegations close after a successful result by default.
  Use `--retain-workspace` only when the user needs the successful terminal to remain available.
  Durable `--session` workspaces always remain open.
  Failed, stopped, timed-out, and observer-failed one-shot workspaces remain available for inspection, then expire after 24 hours unless `--retain-workspace` was selected.
- A successful input POST, `sentBytes`, process existence, or a `running` event proves neither that a command was submitted nor that an agent is still working. Confirm pane output with `wmuxctl output`/`wait` and distinguish the latest agent turn from a persistent idle TUI process.
- Reused workspaces with multiple tabs require `--tab` or `--pane` for `run` and `ps`. Name support tabs when creating them, close task-owned abandoned tabs, and hand off the direct URL for the actual agent tab.
- `wmuxctl run` and `ps` wait for a newly created shell prompt before sending input.
  Keep that guard enabled unless intentionally testing startup behavior; `--no-wait-ready` can reproduce the raw race.
- `wmuxctl open`, `run`, and `ps` arm agent workspaces for fallback cleanup after 24 hours.
  `run` and `ps` additionally accelerate cleanup after a successful `wmux-run` lifecycle event.
  Use `run --close-on-match` or `ps --close-on-complete` when the helper itself observes the definitive completion marker.
  Use `--retain-workspace` for an interactive shell, a user-monitored service, or evidence that must outlive the fallback window.
- `wmuxctl run`, `send`, and `ps` submit Enter separately from the command text so PSReadLine can consume the final pasted bytes. Keep this behavior when extending the helper; combining a long Windows line and `\r` in one input request can truncate the tail or leave the command unsubmitted.
- Prefer `wmuxctl ps` for short Windows multi-step scripts, with `--wait` for one-shot work. Windows Defender can reject `pwsh -EncodedCommand`; do not use it for large scripts or as a transport for long agent prompts. Use a checked-in/staged script or start the TUI with a short command and bracketed-paste the prompt after it is ready.
- `wmuxctl run` and `wmuxctl ps` do not create a running agent event by default. Use `wmux-run -- ...` inside the command for spawned process progress. Add `--agent-event` only when the agent will later call `wmuxctl finish`; otherwise the workspace spinner can stay running after the process exits.
- For one-shot automated work that opened an agent event, record the final event with `wmuxctl finish`.
  A completed event arms automatic cleanup, and `--close` remains available when the caller has already captured the result and wants immediate synchronous closure.
  Keep a failed workspace only while it is diagnostically useful.
  At workflow completion, close superseded failures and abandoned setup workspaces with `wmuxctl cleanup --workspace <id>`.
- Do not dump full process command lines from wmux-managed Windows shells. They can contain encoded wmux bootstrap URLs or tokens. Select safe fields such as `ProcessId`, `Name`, `CreationDate`, and service/task state unless the user explicitly needs command-line debugging.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target machine id and verify it is reachable.
2. Create or reuse one titled workspace for the task. Keep reusing the returned `paneId`; do not create a new workspace for each diagnostic command.
3. If the workspace has multiple tabs, run `wmuxctl tabs` and select the intended `--tab` or `--pane`. Do not rely on the server's last active tab.
4. Send commands with `wmuxctl run` for simple shell lines or `wmuxctl ps --wait` for short Windows PowerShell scripts.
5. Verify submission and progress from pane replay. Use a unique `--wait-for`/sentinel when possible; otherwise inspect `wmuxctl output` for the actual prompt, tool calls, completion, or failure.
6. Wrap substantive commands in `wmux-run -- ...` from inside the pane so process progress and exit status come from run metadata instead of an agent spinner.
7. Use `wmuxctl run --agent-event`, `wmuxctl ps --agent-event`, or `wmux-agent-event` only for agent-level work that will end with `wmuxctl finish` or a final `wmux-agent-event completed|failed|stopped`.
8. For successful agent-level work, run `wmuxctl finish --workspace <workspaceId> --status completed --summary "..."`; add `--close` when immediate closure is useful.
9. Before handing off a completed workflow, reconcile every recorded workspace id.
   Close superseded failures, setup panes, and abandoned lanes with one idempotent `wmuxctl cleanup` call.
   Retain only active interactive work or evidence the user still needs.
10. Report the direct URL for each retained agent tab, pane id, machine id, current turn status, and retention reason.

## Visible Agent Sessions

For a delegated task, prefer the structured command:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py delegate codex MACHINE \
  --directory /absolute/project \
  --prompt-file /private/path/task.md \
  --title "Descriptive task" \
  --session --accept-trust
```

On Windows, use a drive-absolute or home-relative directory and the Codex runtime.
Record the returned `workspaceId` and pass it as `--session-workspace` for every follow-up in the same workstream.
Replace `codex` with `claude`, `opencode`, or `prime-agent` as requested on POSIX targets.
Add `--write-access` for edits and `--unattended` only with explicit authorization; Prime Agent one-shots require both flags.
Use `--sandbox danger-full-access` only when the operator explicitly requests no Codex sandboxing; it does not enable unattended approval.
Omit `--session` and add `--structured-outcome` only for an atomic Codex task whose caller requires a machine-shaped blocked/completed result.
OpenCode additionally requires `--write-access` because its adapter cannot enforce read-only execution. Prime Agent requires both full-access acknowledgements, runs JSON mode with `--no-session`, and never maps `--unattended` to `--autonomous`.

For an interactive OpenCode, Codex, Claude, or Prime Agent TUI:

1. Create or reuse one clearly named agent tab and record its exact pane id.
2. Preflight authentication and every required MCP server by actually starting or calling it. A config/listing command only proves registration, not readiness; missing environment variables can still make startup fail.
3. Start the TUI with a short command. Inspect pane output for repository-trust or first-run prompts and answer them deliberately.
4. Send long prompts as bracketed paste after the TUI is ready instead of embedding them in a shell command or PowerShell encoded command.
5. Confirm real activity from recent pane output or agent transcript events. A persistent TUI PID after `task_complete` is idle, not actively iterating.
6. Keep agent events aligned with turn lifecycle, preferably through reviewed/trusted hooks. Never leave a manual `running` event behind after the turn completes.
