# wmux API And Machines

## Service Discovery

- Static config: `WMUX_CONFIG_PATH`, `./wmux.config.json`, or `~/.wmux/config.json`
- Dynamic machines: the heartbeat registry exposed through `/api/bootstrap`
- User service: `wmux.service`
- Token sources: `WMUX_TOKEN`, `WMUX_TOKEN_PATH`, or `~/.wmux/token`
- Browser mode: `WMUX_BROWSER_AUTH_MODE` (`shared-or-login` by default, or
  opt-in `login-only`). Login-only requires password credentials, persistent
  session material, and distinct automation/helper credentials.
- Scoped sources: `WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`/`WMUX_AUTOMATION_TOKEN_PATH` and
  `WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN`/`WMUX_HELPER_TOKEN_PATH`. Provision with
  `node scripts/wmux-provision-scoped-auth.mjs`; values are never printed.
  Scoped credentials are header-only, query parameters are rejected, and
  failed scoped auth is never retried with a fallback token.
- URL sources: `WMUX_URL`, `~/.wmux/url`, then `http://127.0.0.1:3478`

The static config also owns the browser `keybindings` map. Omitted actions use
wmux defaults, an empty array disables one action, and changes take effect
after restarting wmux. Keybindings are returned by `/api/bootstrap`; they are
not part of the writable server settings API.

All `/api/*` endpoints except `/api/health`, `/api/auth-info`, and `/api/login` require normal wmux authorization. `POST /api/registry/hosts` is the exception: it always requires the separate catalog-write registration token from `WMUX_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` or `~/.wmux/registration-token`, even when main auth is disabled. The shared token can create or update any dynamic ID, so provision it only to trusted hosts.

Never print or commit the token. Prefer environment variables or local token files.

## Machine Discovery

Never assume example IDs are present. Read `/api/bootstrap` before acting and
use the exact IDs and reachability details returned by that deployment. The
examples below use `linux-box` and `windows-box` only as placeholders.

## Dynamic Host Registry

`POST /api/registry/hosts` registers a host and refreshes its presence TTL. It
requires `Authorization: Bearer <registration-token>` and never accepts the
normal browser/shared token as a substitute. `GET /api/registry/hosts` and
`DELETE /api/registry/hosts/:machineId` use normal wmux authorization; the GET
response is redacted.

The POST body has this shape:

```json
{
  "machine": {
    "id": "build-host",
    "name": "Build Host",
    "kind": "ssh",
    "user": "operator",
    "port": 22,
    "sessionBackend": "auto"
  },
  "ttlMs": 90000,
  "metadata": { "os": "linux" }
}
```

Only `ssh` and `powershell-ssh` plus remote-safe connection/session fields are
accepted. `host` may be present for compatibility but is ignored; wmux dials
the validated heartbeat source address. Commands, local/service kinds, agent
URLs, and stream gateway fields are rejected. An observed-host Windows agent
must include both `agentPort` and `agentToken` with `sessionBackend: "agent"`;
the token remains server-only. A persisted pane pins the connection descriptor
and agent token while permitting address-only roaming; a live agent pane pins
its address too. Close referenced panes before descriptor/token rotation.

TTL defaults to 90 seconds and may be 30 seconds through 24 hours. Expired
hosts stay visible offline and are retained for seven days, or longer while a
persisted pane references them. The same ID may heartbeat no more than once per
five seconds; limits are 256 records, 32 records per observed address, and 16
KiB of serialized metadata per record. Host files are
`~/.wmux/url`, `~/.wmux/registration-token`, and
`~/.wmux/heartbeat.json`. Validate with `wmux-heartbeat --once`; install the
POSIX timer with `scripts/install-heartbeat-service.sh`. On Windows, provision
the same files and run `wmux-windows-setup install-agent`; the base agent owns
the heartbeat and retires the legacy standalone task. Registration token
transfer is always a separate manual provisioning step.

Registered panes stage helper commands but do not receive the broad
`WMUX_TOKEN` and do not overwrite a remote `~/.wmux/token`. Dynamic Windows
bootstrap uses a per-machine capability for a redacted inline bundle. Helpers
that post to wmux require separately provisioned normal/scoped auth and
  otherwise return `401`.

In login-only mode, automation is limited to reviewed controller operations and
pane-output WebSocket access; helper auth is limited to helper event/title,
notification, media, clipboard, stream, and profile operations. Browser
sessions retain the first-party UI only after password login. Registration and
registered-host bootstrap remain isolated credential classes.

## Common Checks

Use the skill helper:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py machines
```

Equivalent raw API:

```bash
WMUX_URL=${WMUX_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:3478}
WMUX_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.wmux/token)
curl -fsS -H "authorization: Bearer $WMUX_TOKEN" "$WMUX_URL/api/bootstrap" |
  jq '.machines[] | {id, kind, reachable, endpoint, backendDetail, reason}'
```

For service status on the wmux server:

```bash
systemctl --user status wmux.service
journalctl --user -u wmux.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

## Create A Visible Workspace

Raw API:

```bash
WMUX_URL=${WMUX_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:3478}
WMUX_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.wmux/token)
curl -fsS -X POST "$WMUX_URL/api/workspaces" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $WMUX_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"machineId":"linux-box","createdBy":"agent"}' | jq '.workspace'
```

The returned workspace has `id`, `activeTabId`, and the active pane under `tabs[].panes[]`. A browser URL has this shape:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3478/workspaces/<workspaceId>/tabs/<tabId>
```

Set a manual title when the workspace is for a user-visible task:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$WMUX_URL/api/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/title" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $WMUX_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Windows smoke"}'
```

## Send Terminal Input

Posting input starts the pane process if it is not already running.

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$WMUX_URL/api/panes/$PANE_ID/input" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $WMUX_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":"wmux-run -- npm test\r","cols":120,"rows":36}'
```

Use `\r` for Enter. Keep each input payload under 256 KiB.

Use `scripts/wmuxctl.py run <machine> --line '<shell line>'` to create a workspace and send one line in a single step. The `--line` value is sent exactly as terminal input; write the line for the target shell:

- POSIX hosts: `wmux-run -- bash -lc 'cd ~/repo && npm test'`
- Windows PowerShell hosts: `wmux-run -- pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command "Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object CsName,WindowsVersion"`

Give automated work a descriptive `--title`. Workspaces created by `wmuxctl` are persisted with `createdBy: "agent"`, which gives them a stable `AI` badge in the workspace rail. `wmuxctl open`, `run`, and `ps` reuse the latest workspace with the same machine/title by default, which prevents a diagnostic loop from creating many generic workspaces. Pass `--new` only for intentionally separate sessions.

For a newly created workspace, `run` and `ps` wait until the shell prompt is visible before sending input. This avoids losing or duplicating input during SSH/PowerShell bootstrap. Use `--no-wait-ready` only when deliberately testing that startup path.

When a reused workspace has multiple tabs, `run` and `ps` require an explicit `--tab` or `--pane`. Inspect and manage tabs without raw API calls:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tabs --machine windows-box --title "Runner repair"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tab-open --workspace ws_abc123 --target-machine windows-box --tab-title "Codex"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tab-title --workspace ws_abc123 --tab tab_abc123 --tab-title "Codex - Repair"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py tab-close --workspace ws_abc123 --tab tab_unused
```

For multi-step Windows work, prefer the PowerShell helper:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py ps windows-box \
  --title "Runner repair" \
  --summary "Check runner task and toolchain" \
  --script "Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName gitea-act-runner | Select-Object TaskName,State" \
  --wait
```

`wmuxctl ps` sends a child `pwsh -EncodedCommand` and appends a completion sentinel. `--wait` confirms that the unique sentinel reached pane output; without it, the JSON response only confirms input delivery. Keep encoded scripts short: Windows Defender may reject encoded commands, and long prompts should be bracketed-pasted into an already-running agent TUI instead.

`wmuxctl run` and `wmuxctl ps` intentionally do not create a `running` agent event unless `--agent-event` is passed. For spawned process progress, wrap the pane command with `wmux-run -- ...`; that records start/completion/exit status and clears when the process exits. Use `--agent-event` only for agent-level work that will call `wmuxctl finish` or post a final `wmux-agent-event completed|failed|stopped`.

Inspect or wait for pane output through the authenticated output-only websocket:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py output pane_abc123 --tail-chars 8000
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py wait pane_abc123 --pattern "Do you trust|task_complete" --timeout 30 --show-output
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py send pane_abc123 --line "npm test" --wait-for "Tests passed" --timeout 120
```

Treat `sentBytes`, a process id, and a `running` event as delivery/lifecycle metadata, not proof of active work. Verify the current pane output or agent transcript, and remember that an interactive agent process can remain alive and idle after its latest turn reports `task_complete`.

When an agent-created, one-shot workspace completes successfully and no user inspection is needed, record the final event and close it:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/wmux/scripts/wmuxctl.py finish \
  --workspace "$WORKSPACE_ID" \
  --status completed \
  --summary "Task completed; results are in ~/repo/output.json" \
  --close
```

For failed runs, debugging sessions, interactive work, or long-running processes the user should monitor, omit `--close` so the terminal remains available.

## Other Useful Endpoints

- `GET /api/bootstrap`: machines, workspaces, notifications, agent events, runs, settings, streams.
- `POST /api/workspaces`: body `{ "machineId": "linux-box", "createdBy": "agent" }`; omit `createdBy` for browser/user-created workspaces.
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/:workspaceId`: close a workspace and kill its pane sessions.
- `POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/tabs`: body `{ "machineId": "local" }`.
- `POST /api/tabs/:tabId/split`: body `{ "paneId": "...", "direction": "horizontal"|"vertical", "machineId": "..." }`.
- `POST /api/panes/:paneId/input`: body `{ "data": "...", "cols": 120, "rows": 36 }`.
- `POST /api/agent-events`: body may include `workspaceId`, `tabId`, `paneId`, `agent`, `status`, `title`, `summary`, `body`.
- `POST /api/run-events`: used by `wmux-run` for activity tracking.
- `GET /api/registry/hosts`: list redacted dynamic registration records using normal wmux auth.
- `POST /api/registry/hosts`: register/heartbeat an allowlisted `ssh` or `powershell-ssh` descriptor using the registration token.
- `DELETE /api/registry/hosts/:machineId`: remove a dynamic registration using normal wmux auth.
- `POST /api/streams/:machineId/request`: request a screen stream lease.
- `DELETE /api/streams/:machineId/request/:requestId`: release a stream lease.

## Helper Commands Inside Panes

New local panes have the wmux repo `scripts/` directory on `PATH`. New SSH panes stage helpers under `~/.cache/wmux/bin` and common user bin dirs. New Windows panes stage scripts and shims under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wmux\bin`.

Use:

- `wmux-run -- <command>` to record command start/completion.
- `wmux-agent-event --agent codex --status running|completed|failed --title ... --summary ...` for sidebar activity and completion notifications.
- `wmux-notify --title ... --subtitle ... --body ...` for browser notifications.
- `wmux-copy`/`wclip` to hand text to the browser clipboard.
- `wmux-media <file>` for browser-aware images/audio/video.
- `wmux-title --title ... --descriptor ...` for workspace/tab labeling.
- `wmux-heartbeat --once` to validate or refresh a dynamic host registration; its dedicated token is provisioned separately from pane auth.

Helpers fall back to `~/.wmux/token` and `~/.wmux/url` when pane environment variables are unavailable.

## Windows Notes

Use `powershell-ssh` from a non-Windows wmux server. It launches local `ssh -tt` and starts remote `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile`; it is not WSMan remoting.

Windows helper setup commands from a fresh wmux pane:

```powershell
wmux-windows-setup validate
wmux-windows-setup persist-path
wmux-windows-setup install-deps
wmux-windows-setup install-stream
wmux-windows-setup stream-status
wmux-windows-setup install-agent
wmux-windows-setup agent-status
```

For agent 0.7 and later, stage new helpers normally and activate them without killing live panes:

```powershell
wmux-windows-agent-service activate-update
```

The agent rejects new pane creation while draining and restarts its Scheduled Task after the final existing pane closes. Use `cancel-update` to resume without restarting. Plain `restart` refuses to run with active panes; `restart --force` is destructive.

If the helper is not on `PATH`, call it by path:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\wmux\bin\wmux-windows-setup.ps1" validate
```

Windows panes are durable across wmux service restarts only when the machine has `sessionBackend: "agent"` and the Windows agent is healthy. Confirm the live backend through `/api/bootstrap` rather than relying on an example config.

When auditing Windows processes from wmux, avoid full `CommandLine` output unless the user asks for it. wmux-managed shells can include encoded bootstrap URLs or tokens in their process command line; prefer `ProcessId`, `Name`, `CreationDate`, service state, scheduled-task state, and explicit version commands.
